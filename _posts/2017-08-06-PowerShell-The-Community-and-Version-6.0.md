The Powershell community has been very good to me for a long time. I've published a few Powershell modules to the [Powershell Gallery](https://www.powershellgallery.com/items?q=doug+finke&x=0&y=0) which are up on [GitHub](https://github.com/dfinke) too.

One published module [PowerShellHumanizer](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/PowerShellHumanizer) which meets all your .NET needs for manipulating and displaying strings, enums, dates, times, timespans, numbers and quantities brought me into contact with [Chris Hunt](https://www.automatedops.com/). He started out doing great pull requests and we began to iterate so frequently on it, I asked if he could be a co-contrbutor and enabled him to push the module whenever he saw fit. We since collaborated on many things and I've learned a lot.

## Powershell V6.0
For me it's exciting when your public work helps others and even more so when it can help the top professionals in the industry make the product better for every one using it.

Chris logged an issue for Powershell's version 6.0 ETS (extended type system) when loading our PowerShellHumanizer module [Errors occurred while loading the format data file](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/3057#issuecomment-311739568).

The Microsoft PowerShell Team used PowerShellHumanizer as a use case and resloved the error for all PowerShell developers. Thank you Microsoft and thank you Chris for making the Humanizer module and PowerShell better.

> Also: Thanks to  [Mehdi Khalili](https://github.com/Humanizr/Humanizer) for writing the C# DLL for .NET Humanizer we wrapped.
