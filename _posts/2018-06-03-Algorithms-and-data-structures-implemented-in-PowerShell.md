With this GitHub repo I'm starting the port of "Algorithms and data structures implemented in PowerShell" -
[dfinke/powershell-algorithms](https://github.com/dfinke/powershell-algorithms).

It includes PowerShell code, tests and is wired to Appveyor.

> Appveyor is a Continuous Integration solution for Windows and more. Build, test, deploy your apps faster, on any platform.

Each commit fires a build, and all the tests are run.

Check it out, leave comments, and consider contributing. I'm porting it from a JavaScript repo/implementation. Is a good opportunity to see how both languages support these important concepts.

## Data Structures
A data structure is a particular way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently. More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data.

## Algorithms
An algorithm is an unambiguous specification of how to solve a class of problems. It is a set of rules that precisely define a sequence of operations.
