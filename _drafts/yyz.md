# Common Mistakes to Avoid when Prompting GitHub Copilot

1. Assuming Copilot knows everything: Copilot is a powerful tool, but it's not all-knowing. It's important to provide as much context as possible when asking for help.

1. Not being specific enough: When asking for help, be as specific as possible about what you're trying to do and what you need help with. This will help Copilot provide more accurate suggestions.

1. Ignoring Copilot's suggestions: Copilot is designed to help you write code more efficiently, but it's up to you to decide whether to use its suggestions or not. Don't ignore Copilot's suggestions without considering them first.

1. Not testing your code: Copilot can help you write code, but it's up to you to test it and make sure it works as expected.

1. Not understanding the code: Copilot can generate code for you, but it's important to understand what the code does and how it works. Don't just copy and paste code without understanding it.

***Suggestions***:
- Avoid using overly complex or convoluted language that could confuse Copilot.
- Don't rely solely on Copilot's suggestions without reviewing them for accuracy and relevance.
- Avoid using incomplete or ambiguous code snippets that could lead to incorrect suggestions.
- Don't use overly general or vague prompts that could lead to irrelevant or incorrect suggestions.
- Avoid using code snippets that are too long or complex for Copilot to understand.
